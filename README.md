# color_detection_open_cv  

## 📌 Project Overview  

This project aims to develop a **real-time system for fruit freshness detection** using **OpenCV and Machine Learning**.  
Initially, we trained a model for **color detection**, and now we are extending it to **fruit freshness detection**.  
Additionally, we are integrating **ECE technologies like Arduino and ROS** to develop a **logistics management system**.  

## 🚀 Project Phases  

### ✅ Phase 1: Color Detection (Completed)  
- Developed a **color-based object detection model** using **OpenCV**.  
- Trained the model to detect objects based on predefined color categories.  

### **⏳ Phase 2: Fruit Freshness Detection (Ongoing)**  
- Implementing a **Deep Learning model** to analyze fruit freshness.  
- Using **image processing** to classify fresh vs. stale fruits.  
- Experimenting with **color & texture analysis** for accurate detection.

### 🔜 Phase 3: Logistic Management System (Upcoming)  
- Integrating freshness detection with **Arduino & ROS (Robot Operating System)**.  
- Developing an automated system for **fruit sorting and logistics management**.  
- Optimizing the sorting mechanism based on freshness detection.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- ✅ **OpenCV** – Image processing & color detection  
- ✅ **Machine Learning** – Training models for **color & freshness detection**  
- ✅ **Python, NumPy, Pandas** – Data preprocessing & model development  
- ✅ **Arduino** – Hardware integration for logistics automation  
- ✅ **ROS (Robot Operating System)** – Automating sorting based on detected freshness
